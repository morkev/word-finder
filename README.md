# Word-Finder
Finds all the possible words you can create from any dictionary with a given set of letters.

A few days ago, I was scrolling through my Twitter feed, and found a rather very interesting puzzle published by <i>The New York Times</i>. Since Java is my main language, I decided to find a solution in such, since most of the "solutions" were cumbersome, too slow, or written in JavaScript in order to create browser applications.

This code implements a Depth First Search algorithm, 2d-arrays, and three other data structures able to keep the program cohesive.
